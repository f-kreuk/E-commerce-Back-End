## Description
 
 The E-commerce-Back-End showcases the back end development of an internet retail company's e-commerce site using the latest technologies. This involves setting up the database connection, initializing and seeding the database, starting the server, and then successfully interacting with the API endpoints for the website using Insomnia Core and various CRUD (create, read, update, and delete) operations.
